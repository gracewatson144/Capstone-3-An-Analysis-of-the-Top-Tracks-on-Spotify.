# Capstone-III
I chose everything! I got to choose what data to analyze. 
I found my data at Kaggle.com 
The data set is of the most popular Spotify songs from the year 2000-2019. 
2,000 songs were analyzed 
I choose to see what valuables affect a song's popularity. 
I got to use my Python skills! Take a look at my colab notebook. 
Watch my powerpoint  presentation to find out some pretty interesting results!
